## About Afrocarb

First, let's take a short walk into the "WHY"...

```
  • 7 of the 10 climate-impact most vulnerable nations are African nations.
  • 9 of 10 impacts and emissions-related green companies in Nigeria want to
    participate in the ETS market but lack easy access.
  • Local impact green projects and businesses across Africa are encouraged verbally
    but investment and international trade trust remain distant.
  • Investment in African-impact projects and businesses dropped {by $45 billion in 2022}.
  • Largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, African communities are regularly hit by
    droughts and floods, with enormous consequences to people’s food security. For example,
    Southern and Northern Nigeria
```
Africa cannot build climate resilience on handouts because they are not sustainable and as Mr. Tony Elumely wrote in his piece which stemmed from his conversation with Senator John Kerry, “As the world continues to experience the daily impact of global warming, whether it is the tragic recent flooding in Pakistan, or the less covered, but equally harmful, persistent environmental degradation of Africa’s Sahel region, leaders need to act, not just talk. Equally, Africa should not just be in the conversation, but actively set the agenda.”


### So, what is Afrocarb?

Afrocarb is a simple-to-use marketplace powered by blockchain technology that enables green projects across Africa to shake hands with global finance in exchange for impact and emissions credits, to scale their impact in local African communities and cities while helping non-green entities meet sustainability targets.
